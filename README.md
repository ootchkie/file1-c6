# file1-c6
This is how i learn.  --Class, cpp

# file2-c6
This is another way, i want to know more about pointers to start
then ,functions in more detail

# file.dat
This is a data file for example/ download it along with file2, then compile and run file2-c6.cpp to see some payroll output to a screen.  This is an exercise from school
